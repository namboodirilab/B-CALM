# Behavior Controller for Associative Learning and Memory (B-CALM): Software and Hardware Introduction 
This readme file briefly introduces the supplementary files for the Behavior controller system for assoctiative learning and memory (B-CALM). You can access the paper for free [here](rdcu.be/dha7x) <br />
 <br />

### [CIRCUIT SCHEMATIC PDF FILE](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/blob/main/circuit%20schematic.pdf)
- This file contains the circuit schematic, building instructions and parts purchase list for our electronic system used in B-CALM.  <br />

### [TASK RUNNING OVERVIEW PDF FILE](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/blob/main/Task%20running%20overview.pdf)
- This file contains the **MATLAB code and GUI setup instructions**, **task running instructions**, **the graphical user interface (GUI) parameters full explanation**, and **possible future tasks and parameter setting explanation**.   <br />

### [TASK CODES FOLDER](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes)
 The first part of this folder contains the **MATLAB GUI code**--[headfix_GUI.m](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/blob/main/task%20codes/headfix_GUI.m), **the actual GUI figure file made in GUIDE**--[headfix_GUI.fig](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/blob/main/task%20codes/headfix_GUI.fig),  and **the data saving and plotting file** for current experiment--[conditioning_prog.m](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/blob/main/task%20codes/conditioning_prog.m).
  
  We have also developed a programmatic GUI, running code with the plotting function in the [programmatic GUI folder](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes/programmatic%20GUI) to adapt to MATLAB's future versions which will discontinue GUIDE. 
  
  
  The second part of this folder contains five Arduino task scripts for running five different experiments. Task parameters and instructions of running each one are documented in the [Task running overview](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/blob/main/Task%20running%20overview.pdf). <br />
  - [Namlab_behavior_cues.ino](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes/Namlab_behavior_cues) - This is experiment mode one in the GUI setting. This is for cue triggered experiments (both Pavlovian and cue-action-reward). <br />
  - [Namlab_behavior_randomrewards.ino](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes/Namlab_behavior_randomrewards) - This is experiment mode two in the GUI, for lick training animals with a poission distribution of rewards. <br />
  - [Namlab_behavior_lickforreward.ino](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes/Namlab_behavior_lickforreward) - This is experiment mode three in the GUI, for operant/instrumental action-reward associated tasks. <br />
  - [Namlab_behavior_decisionmaking.ino](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes/Namlab_behavior_decisionmaking) - This is experiment mode four in the GUI, mainly for decision making tasks with the possible implentation of different cues, reward magnitudes, and delays for either choices. <br />
  - [Namlab_behavior_ramptiming.ino](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/task%20codes/Namlab_behavior_ramptiming) - This is experiment mode six in the GUI, for studying a ramp timing task with reward magnitude varying based on the ramp (not part of the B-CALM paper). <br />
  
  (These five experiments include nearly all possible task combinations and setups for running common associative learning and memory tasks. Other experiment mode task files beyond the scope of the paper are not included here currently since they are being validated. <br />
  
### [DATA ANALYSIS CODES FOLDER](https://github.com/namboodirilab/B-CALM/tree/main/data%20analysis%20codes)  <br />
